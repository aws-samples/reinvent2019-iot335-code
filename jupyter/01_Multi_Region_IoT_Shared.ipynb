    "# Multi-Region IoT with ACM PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "These Jupyter notebooks contain some code snippets for the re:Invent 2019 chalk talk (IOT335) about multi-region IoT setups. The setup assumes that you have a master and a slave region where you want to connect your devices to.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS infrastructure like [AWS IoT topic rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rules.html), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) tables, [AWS Step Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) and [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) functions will be created by [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html). There is one CloudFormation template for the slave region and one for the master region. Please refer to the README to launch the templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The series of Jupyter notebooks let you create an AWS IoT multi-region setup based on the resources launched by CloudFormation. An example to connect devices is also provided as well as some examples to persist data across regions. You'll find the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a multi-region setup for AWS IoT you must bring your own CA. It must be registered in every region which applies to the multi-region setup. The CA will be created with the AWS Certificate Manager's [Private Certificate Authority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html) (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority is a managed private CA service with which you can easily and securely manage your certificate authority infrastructure and your private certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The devices certificates issued by the PCA will be automatically regiseterd using [Just-in-Time registration](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/just-in-time-registration-of-device-certificates-on-aws-iot/).\n",
